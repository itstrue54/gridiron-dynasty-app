# Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-001: Engine is a pure Kotlin/JVM module
Date: 2026-09-05
Status: Accepted

Context: Android-coupled simulation logic would be untestable at speed and
unusable by the planned college football sim.

Decision: :engine has zero Android dependencies. CI enforces this with a grep.

Consequences: Save/load and file access live in :data. Slightly more
boilerplate crossing the module boundary. Calibration can run headless on the
JVM in seconds.

## ADR-002: One market value curve for the whole league
Date: 2026-09-06
Status: Accepted

Context: Free agency, roster generation and release decisions each need to know
what a player is worth. Three implementations of that idea would drift, and a
league where players are created at one price and signed at another does not
stay balanced for more than a season or two.

Decision: `engine/econ/MarketValue` owns the curve. `TeamNeeds.marketValue`
delegates to it; `RosterGenerator` prices generated contracts with it;
`CapManagement` ranks release candidates against it.

Consequences: Changing what a position is worth is a one-line change in one
file. The curve is convex on purpose - the gap between an 88 and an 80 costs
far more than the gap between an 80 and a 72, which is why a roster cannot be
all starters.

## ADR-003: Generated players are signed to staggered contracts
Date: 2026-09-06
Status: Accepted

Context: Generated players had no contracts. The offseason releases anyone
without an active deal, so after one season all 32 rosters emptied into free
agency and were redistributed - an accidental redraft every year, and nothing
for the salary cap to act on.

Decision: `RosterGenerator.sign()` puts every generated player on a deal, term
by age and depth, each player somewhere in the middle of it. Rosters open at
~88% of the cap. Prices are scaled against actual cap hits rather than annual
averages, because deals are back-loaded and the minimum salary is a floor.

Consequences: About a quarter of a roster reaches free agency each year.
Contract signing draws from a `split("contracts")` child stream so it does not
consume draws from the parent - the first version did, which regenerated a
different league and surfaced as a calibration regression three modules away.

## ADR-004: Roster decisions discount age; retirement does not carry the load
Date: 2026-09-06
Status: Accepted

Context: The league aged 25.6 to 26.8 over ten seasons and its mean overall
slid with it. Per-bracket development rates were identical in year one and year
ten, so progression was not the cause - the age mix was. Players over 31 held
20% of roster spots against roughly 10% in the real NFL.

Decision: `rosterValue()` discounts 2.2 rating points per year past 29, and
both the cut-to-53 pass and free agent signing rank on it.

Consequences: Rosters skew young because of front office decisions, which is
how it works in reality. A declining veteran loses his spot to a rookie, enters
free agency, and the existing 70-88% unsigned-retirement path ends his career.
Raising retirement rates directly would have treated the symptom - those
players were never getting cut in the first place.

## ADR-005: The draft board is far deeper than the draft
Date: 2026-09-06
Status: Accepted

Context: 350 prospects for 224 picks meant teams drafted 64% of the board, so
what arrived was barely better than what was generated. Rookies rated 70+
arrived at ~12 a year against a league losing roughly 28 elite players a year
to age. Players rated 80+ rose from 140 to 184 as the founding cohort peaked,
then collapsed to 124 once it aged out.

Decision: `SyntheticDraftClass.BOARD_DEPTH` widens the board to 1.45x - about
507 prospects for the same 224 picks.

Consequences: Selection, not rating inflation, is where the league's talent
comes from. Nothing about what a prospect is worth changed. Undrafted players
still flow into free agency. A deeper board also makes scouting error matter,
since there is more of a board to be wrong about.

## ADR-006: Player prices are relative to the league, not absolute
Date: 2026-09-07
Status: Accepted

Context: The price curve was calibrated against a league whose starters average
79, which is what the generator produces. Leagues settle around 73. The curve
is steeply convex, so a few points of league-wide compression collapsed the
cost of a roster from about 440m to 60m - teams spent 63m of a 255m cap, no
team came within 10m of it, and the cap forced no releases in ten seasons.

Decision: `MarketValue.score()` gives a player's standing in arbitrary units;
`MarketValue.pricer()` turns standing into money by dividing the money actually
chasing players (total league cap space x 0.85) by the total standing of the
free agents who will fill the league's open roster spots.

Consequences: A cap-rich offseason with a thin market is expensive, which is
how it works in reality, and the system stays honest as ratings drift instead
of needing recalibration every time the talent curve moves. Mean cap space fell
from 192m to 54m. One contract is capped at 24% of a team's cap, near where
the real quarterback market sits.

## ADR-007: Salaries are paid on production, not ratings
Date: 2026-09-07
Status: Accepted

Context: Prices were computed from ratings. Nobody in a front office can see a
rating (SPEC 4.6 says the same thing about the UI); they see what a player did.

Decision: `econ/Production` reduces a player's season to one number, normalised
against the median at his position group, and that multiplier scales his price.
Season stats only - career totals would pay a thirty-four year old for what he
did at twenty-six. Linemen and specialists have no counting stats and are
priced on ability, roughly as they are paid in reality.

Consequences: Two properties the market needs, for free. A player coming off a
big year gets paid for it even when the year was partly his offence, his
quarterback or luck - which is where genuinely bad contracts come from, and bad
contracts are what make the cap a game rather than an accounting exercise. And
a good player who sat behind a starter is cheap, because he has not proved
anything, so scouting properly is rewarded.
